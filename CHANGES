 User-visible changes in guile-termios
=======================================

* 0.6.1 → 0.6.2 (released 2021-07-01):

  - Generate GNU Info documentation
  - Move manpage from section 3 to section 7
  - Allow building from read-only sources
  - Enable cross compilation via CFLAGS_ADD=-Tsystem-triple-here

* 0.6 → 0.6.1 (released 2021-06-12):

  - Clean up project structure
  - Reimplement installation routine
  - Use common strategies to simplify library packaging
  - Fix a couple of build system issues


* 0.5 → 0.6 (released 2021-02-20):

  - Add (termios frontends) to implement commonly used termios patterns
  - Support for controlling DTR and RTS modem lines
  - Use errno support from modern Guile instead of privately rolled version
  - Fixes in byte compilation steps
  - Support for non-default guild program names
  - Support for newer versions of pandoc


* 0.4 → 0.5 (released 2014-10-18):

  - Documentation can be installed via Makefile target: install-doc
  - API for accessing c-cc fields added: get-from-c-cc and put-into-c-cc
  - More termios constants added to (termios system)
  - Non-existent constants in (termios system) are not dropped entirely
    anymore but set to ‘#f’.


* 0.3 → 0.4 (released 2014-10-12):

  - Added a reference manual, finally.
  - Optional key argument of ‘tc-set-attr’ changed from #:optional-action
    to #:key. Strictly speaking, this is an API change, but since this
    optional parameter was never documented, I won't bother bumping
    major versions.


* 0.2 → 0.3 (released 2014-10-03):

  - Cygwin support
    This requires Guile 2 in cygwin, which at the time of writing does not
    exist as a pre-built package. If all dependencies are installed, though,
    Guile 2.0 builds fine.
  - Added ‘termios-failure?’
  - Added access to ‘errno’
    - get-errno
    - call-with-errno
  - Added high-level module (termios with-exceptions)
  - Added an actual test-suite (on top of the general plausibility test)
  - Licence switched to 2-clause BSD.

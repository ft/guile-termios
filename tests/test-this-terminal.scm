;; This is quite the trivial test: It works if stdin is connected to a
;; terminal; with that it queries the serial attributes of the terminal and
;; pretty-prints them to stdout. If ‘tc-get-attr!’ fails, the script will throw
;; an exception and the test will therefore fail. It's not much of a test, but
;; it makes sure, the module isn't complete broken.
